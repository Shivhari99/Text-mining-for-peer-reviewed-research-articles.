# Text-mining-for-peer-reviewed-research-articles.
The text analysis and classification is a technique to classify the types of texts, the sentiments of the person who wrote the text and analyzes whether the text is positive, neutral or negative. Thus the text analysis system is an important part of modern AI based software which tells the users response according the text user types. The sentiment analysis is a necessary part of all the online shopping services which can tell the admins of the site whether the customers are happy or sad or neutral for their products. In this project we are working on the implementation of the machine learning solution for the text classifications of the peer reviewed research articles, which will going to tell us whether the reviews are positive, negative and neutral. In this project we have worked on the dataset which contains the numbers of mixed review scores and acceptance status. We created and trained the model which classifies the text and then predicts the number of positive and negative reviews with the percentage of accuracy. For the implementation of model we used the python as language and colab for the environment at first we imported all the required libraries these are numpy, pandas,sklearn and spacy for the text reviews.
